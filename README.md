# Gideon

Welcome to Gideon, the terminal wizard for organizing files and directories!

With Gideon, you can easily remove duplicate files, rename files, and organize them by topic. Simply navigate to the desired directory in your terminal and use one of the following commands:

- `duplicates [dir_path] [autodelete]`: removes duplicate files from the specified `dir_path`. Use the optional `autodelete` flag (True/False) to automatically delete duplicates.
- `rename [dir_path]`: renames files in the specified `dir_path`.
- `organize [dir_input] [dir_output]`: organizes files from the `dir_input` directory and places them in the `dir_output` directory.

To use Gideon, make sure to have the required dependencies installed and run the script with python app.py.

We hope you find Gideon useful in your file management tasks!
